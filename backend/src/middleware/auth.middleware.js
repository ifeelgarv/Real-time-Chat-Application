// If you're storing a JWT or session token in a cookie (like in your signup/login flow), youâ€™ll likely need to read that cookie later for authentication. cookie-parser makes that simple.

// The purpose of these lines is to authenticate the user for every protected route by verifying their JWT token, then attaching the user's information to the request object so that it can be used throughout the route handler. For example, when accessing a route like GET /profile, you can now access req.user to know which user is making the request.
